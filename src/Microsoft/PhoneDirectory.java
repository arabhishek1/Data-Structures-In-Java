 Given a list of contacts which exist in a phone directory. The task is to implement search query for the phone
 directory. The search query on a string ‘str’ displays all the contacts which prefix as ‘str’. One special property of
 the search function is that, when a user searches for a contact from the contact list then suggestions (Contacts with
 prefix as the string entered so for) are shown after user enters each character.


 Note : Contacts in the list consist of only lower case alphabets.

 Example:

 Input : contacts [] = {“gforgeeks” , “geeksquiz” }
 Query String = “gekk”

 Output : Suggestions based on "g" are
 geeksquiz
 gforgeeks

 Suggestions based on "ge" are
 geeksquiz

 No Results Found for "gek"

 No Results Found for "gekk"
